\doom should be \doom{}. There are many DOOMxxxx typos :(!
is it ticks or tics?
check michael abrash is thanked in doom credits
In teams chapter, Add a "on XXX they tried to upload the game on the ftp but they could not connect"
Review all 32-bit XXX 32 bits. CHECK: Bit when used in a prenominal phrase is singular (This is a 3-meter-long bureau.
Doom awards page from romero
Elaborate on RAM and SRAM for leaks, read-write and dual bit for sdram. Recommend book for fast page explanation (which book is it the system or the pyramid book?).
Take about gamma (Apple, NeXT and SGI had linear color space while PC did not). 4444 linear space of next
Learn about perspective correct, subpixel accurate texture mapping.
Get the license to use Sandy Patersen interview at the end of the book.
You might want to mention the high end Roland sound cards in passing; not many gamers had them, but the Doom music sounded awesome on them!
To double check with book but i am pretty sure it does: P34: I don’t think DRAM access used the “ISA bus protocol” on 386, but I may be fuzzy on that.
Fixed point -> fixed-point
Ask romero for high resolution photos of Tom Hall
mention sc-55 used by billy bob.


JOHN CARMACK FEEDBACK:
======================
You mention “overdrive and writeback”, but don’t say that writeback was a cache improvement versus the older writethroguh.
P46: I don’t think “a vast majority” of PC games used Mode­ Y.  Even among the Doom licensees, most preferred the simplicity of straight 13h.
P51: “tibpal” ? Is this a typo, or some special kind of PAL (Programmable Array Logic)?
P59: “On the lambda customer side” ?
P82: The 16­bit color was only 4444, 1555 was not supported, which was unfortunate for us.  It was also in a linear color space, as opposed to the non­linear PC standard that became sRGB.  I didn’t understand how to properly convert back then, so our graphics always looked washed out on the NeXT systems.
P121: A designer could make something playable in under 20 minutes, but all the real maps had days of work in them,
unlike Wolfenstein, where a couple of the later maps really were made in an hour or so.
P126:  I wouldn’t call BLOCKMAP an AABB, but rather a “grid”.  AABB is usually Axis Aligned Bounding Box, which is a
different thing in collision detection.
P131: To be fair to DOS, we did usually use the extended 80 column mode to get 50 lines.
P14); There were a couple limitations on what could be overridden from the wad files; I don’t remember clearly, but I think there were problems with some sprites?
