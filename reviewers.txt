CHECK: Bit when used in a prenominal phrase is singular (This is a 3-meter-long bureau.).
486 layout
Doom awards page from romero
Elaborate on RAM and SRAM for leaks, read-write and dual bit for sdram. Recommend book for fast page explanation (which book is it the system or the pyramid book?).
Take about gamma (Apple, NeXT and SGI had linear color space while PC did not). 4444 linear space of next
Learn about perspective correct, subpixel accurate texture mapping.


JOHN CARMACK FEEDBACK:
======================

“audio cards clone on the market” ­> “audio card clones on the market”
P24: “A CPU unable to perform floating­point” The 486 DC did have floating point, but we still considered the 386 our min spec.
P34: I don’t think DRAM access used the “ISA bus protocol” on 386, but I may be fuzzy on that.
P36: “Will in a loop” ­> “While in a loop”
P39: “If a value was to be written…” The discussion of LRU eviction might best done with a read, because writes are more complicated.
I had to check whether the 486 was write­allocate or not ­­ The initial 486 caches were write­through, although some later ones added write­back, but they were all write­allocate.

P40: “Netburst” was the Pentium­4 microarchitecture, are you sure this was also a memory timing name?
You mention “overdrive and writeback”, but don’t say that writeback was a cache improvement versus the older writethroguh.
P46: I don’t think “a vast majority” of PC games used Mode­Y.  Even among the Doom licensees, most preferred the
simplicity of straight 13h.
P47: footnote 31 “Every VGA mask tricks” ­> “VGA mask tricks”, it certainly wasn’t all of them!
P50: “designed and sold semiconductor chips” ­> “sold semiconductor designs” maybe? Or did they make chips to sell to
board vendors, which wouldn’t be “fabless” in the modern sense?
P51: “tibpal” ? Is this a typo, or some special kind of PAL (Programmable Array Logic)?
P52: 40x to 100x faster is wrong, shouldn’t it be 2x for width and 4x for clock?
You might want to mention the high end Roland sound cards in passing; not many gamers had them, but the Doom music
sounded awesome on them!
P59: “On the lambda customer side” ?
P60” “dommed all night” ­> “doomed all night”
You might want to mention the tradeoffs in latency that modems made to get the higher bit rates.  A 9600 baud modem
played DOOM better than the default configurations of 56kbit modems.  Quake needed more bandwidth than Doom’s
controller replication, so it became a different tradeoff.
P65: “where registers where 16­bit” ­> “where registers were 16­bit”
P67: “join operating system” ­> “joint operating system”
P68: “Not only they were” ­> “Not only were they”
P73: Macintosh mediocre ­> Macintosh’s mediocre
P74: featuring “surface mount” ­> possibly remove, or change to “supporting surface mount technology”?
P82: Designer picked elements ­> Designers picked elements
P82: The 16­bit color was only 4444, 1555 was not supported, which was unfortunate for us.  It was also in a linear color space, as opposed to the non­linear PC standard that became sRGB.  I didn’t understand how to properly convert back then, so our graphics always looked washed out on the NeXT systems.
P93: and also test the game ­> and to test the game
P96: NeXT has hardware manufacturer ­> NeXT as hardware manufacturer
P96: Intel, SPARC, and MIPS ­> Intel, SPARC, and PA­RISC
P98: which when from behind four weeks ­> which went from four weeks
P98: “Even if nor for the kernel” ­> I bet there *ARE* parts of the kernel still compiled into OS­X!
P99: an other faction ­> another faction
P99: thirteen person ­> thirteen people
P99: Romero should be credited with Programming / Design
P100: Tom was actually fired, but I’m fine with it being characterized as “Tom leaves”
P101: Romero’s doom jammed ­> Romero’s door jammed.
P104: Maybe the place to explain “gibs” as “giblets’ and mention the often argued about pronunciation.
P110: Tom Halls’s ­> Tom Hall’s
P118: A designed worked ­> A designer worked
P118: Mention the masked middle textures for bars and so on?
P120: The killing feature ­> The killer feature
P121: A designer could make something playable in under 20 minutes, but all the real maps had days of work in them,
unlike Wolfenstein, where a couple of the later maps really were made in an hour or so.
P125: The rject visualization isn’t very informative.  Including sector numbers and a big grid truth table would be better, but a good chunk of work to produce.  Maybe print the grid and just manually label three sectors to illustrate a pass and fail in the table?
P126:  I wouldn’t call BLOCKMAP an AABB, but rather a “grid”.  AABB is usually Axis Aligned Bounding Box, which is a
different thing in collision detection.
P127: magazines relied information ­> magazines relayed information?
P128: The oldest plan how to have been preserved ­> The oldest plan known to have been preserved
P130: Tom Halls ­> Tom Hall
P131: To be fair to DOS, we did usually use the extended 80 column mode to get 50 lines.
P135: Many years later, while evangelizing static code analysis, I would rant a bit about how the sloppy programming
permitted by dynamic languages like ObjC was Not A Good Thing.
P135: AB ­> IB for Interface Builder?
P135: While NeXT didn’t tout it, the basic reliable Unix core was a good chunk of the value prop for us, in addition to IB and ObjC.
P14); There were a couple limitations on what could be overridden from the wad files; I don’t remember clearly, but I think there were problems with some sprites?
