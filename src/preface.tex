This is the second book in the \textit{Game Engine Black Book} series. After Wolfenstein 3D which was published in 1991, it is the turn of the next game id Software from December 1993, \doom. The author faced two seemingly orthogonal constraints while writing this book. On one side let it stand alone, be complete by itself and not require anything from the precious entry in the series. On the other side, avoid boring faithful readers with content already mentioned in the first tome.\\
\par
I tried to keep reusing content as much as possible but I ultimately sided with new comers since it is a frustrating experience to read something constantly referring you to read something else. I hope readers with previous knowledge from \textit{Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D} will forgive me for bringing up again things like VGA architecture, floating point internals, and segmented memory. It is in no way a cheap stratagem to increase the page count. I would have preferred to stay below 300 pages but the complexity of the engine code and my love for details prevented it.
