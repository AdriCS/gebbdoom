To create a map, a design worked with only a few elements: \cw{VERTEX}, \cw{LINE}, \cw{SIDEDEF}, and \cw{SECTORS}.\\

The tool to create the maps tool a lot of work. The Doom EDitor was to be called DoomED. Entirely written in Objective-C and running on NeXTStep it benefited from InterfaceBuilder.\\
\par
Since the source code was release in 20XX, we can compare it to the game engine. It turns out there is almost the same amount of code!\\

\section{Map Preprocessor}
\cw{doombsp} processes output from DoomED (XXX files) into XXX, XXX, and XXX. It was released very shorty after Doom shareware on April, 6th 1994. It is a small code base which was critical to the modding community since it enabled enthusiast to compile and inject their own maps into Doom.\\
