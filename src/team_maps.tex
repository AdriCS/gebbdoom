\section{Maps}
Maps were designed in a top-down view. The only limitations were that walls were perpendicular to floors and both floors and walls were horizontal so everything was drawn in 2D. A designer worked with five types of element: \cw{VERTEX}\footnote{Vertex coordinates were expressed with signed short integers [-32768, 32767]. 32 units translate to roughly one meter (or 3.28 feet for poor souls who must use the imperial system.)}, \cw{LINE}, \cw{SIDEDEF}, \cw{SECTOR}, and \cw{THING}.\\

\par
A \cw{SECTOR} is a closed area surrounded by \cw{LINE}s with a specified floor height, floor texture, ceiling height, ceiling texture, and light level. A sector can be concave, but lines cannot cross each other.\\
\par
A \cw{LINE} can either be a solid wall or a portal between two \cw{SECTOR}s. The difference is in the number of \cw{SIDEDEF}s associated with it. A wall has only one \cw{SIDEDEF} on its right side and is fully opaque. A portal has two \cw{SIDEDEF}s and can usually be partially seen though.\\
\par
A \cw{SIDEDEF} describes one side of a \cw{LINE}. To accommodate texturing of both t walls and portals, it can have up to three textures. The middle texture is used by walls for the full area they cover. A \cw{SIDEDEF} can also have a lower and an upper texture for portals connecting \cw{SECTOR}s with different ceiling/floor heights. If the portal leads to a sector with higher floor, the lower texture is used to render the "step". If the \cw{SECTOR} connects to a \cw{SECTOR} with a lower ceiling, the upper texture is used to render the "down step". To help alignment of doors and buttons, \cw{SIDEDEF} textures can have a vertical/horizontal offset. \\
\par
A \cw{THING} is much simpler in comparison. It only has one pair of \cw{VERTEX} coordinates, an angle and an identifier controlling its type. At the bare minimum a map must have one player-spawning location \cw{THING}.\\

\par
The resulting scene in figure \ref{doom_map.png} is ugly but the mismatched colors hopefully help to discern the different elements. All \cw{LINE}s are walls except for \cw{E-B} which has two \cw{SIDEDEF}s and is therefore a portal. All walls use the \cw{BRIK} middle texture except for the portal which uses \cw{GRAY} for both top and bottom.\\
\par
\cw{SECTOR} \#0 uses a \cw{RED} floor texture and a \cw{WOOD} ceiling texture. The height of the floor is 20 and its ceiling is at 40. \cw{SECTOR} \#1 uses a \cw{BLUE} floor texture and a \cw{GREEN} ceiling texture. Its floor is at 60 and ceiling at 60. Both sectors have the same light level (10).\\
\par
   Notice the portal \cw{E-B} which does not have a mid-texture but an upper and lower texture. These were used to draw the up-step and down-step towards sector \#0.\\
\par
Also notice wall \cw{D-E} on which mid-texture vertical offset is not correctly set, resulting in a vertical tear when connecting with wall \cw{E-F}. Wall \cw{B-C}'s vertical offset is properly set and has no visual artifact. None of the walls use a horizontal offset, but the corresponding field is labelled \cw{XOFF} on figure \ref{doom_map_basics} to show its location.\\

\subsection{Map Editor (DoomED)}
To harness the complexity of the map format, a new tool was created. The Doom map editor was to be called \textbf{DoomED}. This is where the \NeXT solution gave the most impact. The high resolution of the display allowed a lot of real-estate showing small details and many widgets. The stability of NeXTSTEP allowed one to never lose work while writing DoomED or creating a map.
The very design of Objective-C also had a tremendous influence. The language's message-dispatching system gracefully handled \cw{nullptr}\footnote{"Understanding the Objective-C Runtime".} dereferences, resulting in a fault-forgiving environment where a faulty feature would not work but did not crash either.\\
\par   
The killer feature was Interface Builder which not only came with a full library of widgets but also allowed creating new ones and connecting them to the business logic instantly.\\
\par

The release of the source code in April 2015 allowed programmers to peek inside. There is almost as much code as in the game engine (doom:32kloc, DoomED:20kcloc). Without the power of \NeXT, the editor would have taken at least twice the same amount of time to make.



\tcode{cloc_doomed.txt}

DoomED was designed to be the "Adobe Illustrator for World Maps" where the designer simply drew lines, selected sectors , and picked textures.\\

\vspace{-4mm}
DoomED did not output data usable by the game engine directly. Instead it generated a text format output called \cw{DWD}. A header served as magic number which was followed by a list of lines (including sidedefs) and a list of things. Sectors were inferred from line's ceiling/floor textures values.\\
\par
\tcode{map.txt}
\par
DWD was not designed with space efficiency in mind but rather was designed to be easy to parse since it was processed by the Node Builder tool, \cw{doombsp}.\\

\section{Map Preprocessor (Node Builder)}
Map preprocessing was not something new at id. Since 1991 with Wolfenstein 3D, maps were already pre-processed to allow fast sound propagation. With \doom, it was taken to a whole new level both in terms of complexity and processing time.\\
\par
The main issue at hand was to maintain the same rendering speed despite relaxing the orthogonal grid constraints of Wolfenstein and losing the ability to use the DDA algorithm \footnote{Digital Differential Analyzer was used extensively for VSD (Visual Surface Determination), collision detection and line-of-sight calculations. This was all gone with \doom.}. The solution chosen was to generate a multitude of accelerating data structures for each map, each dedicated to solving a particular problem.\\
\par
 The tool to do that was called \cw{doombsp}. It took as input a \cw{.DWD} map and outputted a \cw{.WAD}. Not only was the map expressed in a space-efficient format (e.g. expressing vertices only once and referencing them via index), but three data structures were generated alongside it. A binary space-partitioned version of the map expressed a node tree to speed up rendering. A blockmap accelerated collision detection. Finally, a reject accelerated A.I. processing.\\
 \par
\trivia{Map preprocessing took a significant amount of time. With a NextStation Turbo Color, running \cw{doombsp} on \cw{E1M1} took 10s. On E1M2, it took 30s. On E2M7, it took a full minute. The first nine maps of the shareware took 3m26s. The full twenty seven maps of the registered version took 11 minutes.}\\% This was a problem for designers...yet it was little compared to what Quake's \cw{qbsp} would be three years later.}\\
\par
\tcode{cloc_doombsp.txt}
\par
 \trivia{\cw{DoomED.app}, \cw{doom} and \cw{doombsp} were tightly integrated. One button in the editor was enough to save the map, invoke the node builder and start the game with the WIP map.}

The source code of the node builder was released shortly after the game in May 1994. It was the NeXTSTEP version but it was quickly converted to DOS and released under the name IDBSP to the delight of a hoard of modders.\\

Slicing the map via binary partitioning is non-trivial. \cw{doombsp}'s heuristic attempts to minimize the number of segments generated while creating a balanced tree and picking axis-aligned splitting lines. A debug flag \cw{-draw} allowed monitoring what was happening. BSP trees and binary partitioning are explained in detail on page \pageref{Binary Space Partitioning: Theory}. \\
