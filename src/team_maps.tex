\section{Maps}
Maps were designed in a top-down view. The only limitation was that walls were perpendicular to floors. Everything could be done in 2D. A designed worked with only a few elements: \cw{VERTEX}\footnote{Vertices corrdinates were expressed with signed short integer [-32768, 32767]}, \cw{LINE}, \cw{SIDEDEF}, \cw{SECTOR}, and \cw{THING}.\\

\par
A \cw{SECTOR} is an area surrounded by \cw{LINE}s with a specified floor height, floor texture, ceiling height, ceiling texture, and a light level. A sector could be concave, but lines could not cross each others.\\
\par
A \cw{LINE} could either be a solid wall or a portal between two \cw{SECTOR}s. The difference was in the number of \cw{SIDEDEF} associated with it. A wall had only one \cw{SIDEDEF} on its right side and is fully opaque. A portal had two \cw{SIDEDEF}s and can usually be seen though.\\
\par
A \cw{SIDEDEF} describe one side of a line. To accommodate walls and portals texturing it can have up to three textures. The middle texture is used by wall for the full area they cover. There was also a lower texture and an upper texture for portal connecting \cw{SECTOR}s with different ceiling/floor height. If the portal led to a sector with higher floor, the lower texture is used to render the "step". If the \cw{SECTOR} connects to a \cw{SECTOR} with lower ceiling, the upper texture is used to render the "down step". To help aligment with door and buttons, \cw{SIDEDEF} textures could also be offseted vertically and horizontally. \\
\par
A \cw{THING}s is must simpler in comparison. It only had one \cw{VERTEX} coordinate, an angle and an identifier telling its type. As the minimum a map must have one player spawning location \cw{THING}.\\

\par
The resulting scene is ugly but the colors hopefully help to dissociate each elements. All \cw{LINE}s are walls except for \cw{E-B} which has two \cw{SIDEDEF}s and is therefore a portal. All walls use the \cw{BRIK} middle texture except for the portal which uses \cw{GRAY} for both top and bottom.\\
\par
\cw{SECTOR} \#0 uses a \cw{RED} floor texture and a \cw{WOOD} ceiling texture. The height of the floor is 20 and its ceiling is at 40. \cw{SECTOR} \#1 uses a \cw{BLUE} floor texture and a \cw{GREN} ceiling texture. Its floor is at 60 and ceiling at 60. Both sectors have the same light level (10).\\
\par
   Notice the portal \cw{E-B} which did not have a mid-texture but an upper and lower texture. These were used to draw the up-step and down-step to sector \#0.\\
\par
Also notice the wall \cw{D-E} which mid-texture vertical offset was not correctely set, resulting in a vertical tear when connecting with wall \cw{E-F}. Wall \cw{B-C} vertical offset was properly set and result in no visual artifact. None of the wall use an horizontal offset, however field is marked \cw{XOFF} to show its location.\\

\subsection{Map Editor (DoomED)}
To harness the complexity of the map format, a new tool was created. The Doom map EDitor would be called \textbf{DoomED}. This is were \NeXT solution asserted the most impact. The high resolution of the display allowed a lot of real-estate showing small details and many widgets. The stability of NeXTSTEP allowed to never lose work while writing DoomED or creating a map.
The very design of Objective-C also had a tremendous influence. The language's message dispatching system no-op behavior when dereferencing a \cw{nullptr}\footnote{"Understanding the Objective-C Runtime".} created a fault forgiving environment where a feature would not work but did not crash either.\\
\par   
The killing feature was Application Builder which not only came with a full library of widgets but also allowed to create new one and connect them to the business logic instantly.\\

The release of the source code in April 2015 allowed to pick inside. There is almost as much code as in the game engine (doom:32kloc, DoomED:20kcloc). Without the power of \NeXT the editor would have taken at least twice the same amount of time to make.\\
\par
\tcode{cloc_doomed.txt}
\par
DoomED was designed to be the "Adobe Illustrator" of doom maps where the designer simply drew line, selected sectors , and picked textures. A skilled map maker could complete a map in 20 minutes \fixme{citation needed}.\\

DoomED did not output data usable by the game engine directly. Instead it generated a text format output called \cw{DWD}. A header served as magic number which was followed by a list of lines listing sidedefs and a list of things. Sectors were inferred from line's ceiling/floor textures valus.\\
\par
\tcode{map.txt}
\par
DWD was designed with space efficiency in mind but rather to be easy to parse since it was processed by a tool called Node Builder.\\

\section{Map Preprocessor (Node Builder)}
Map preprocessing was not something new at id. Since 1991, Wolfenstein 3D maps had been preprocessed to allow fast sound propagation. However with \doom, it had to be taken to a whole new level in terms of complexity and processing delay. The free form of the walls made the DDA\footnote{Digital differential analyzer, see Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D} algorithm unusable. With the lose of DDA, gone were fast and cheap collision detection/wall sorting.\\
\par
To allow runtime to achieve an acceptable framerate, special optimized datastructures had to be generated. This was the task of 
\cw{doombsp}.\\
\par
 processes output from DoomED (XXX files) into XXX, XXX, and XXX. It was released very shorty after Doom shareware on April, 6th 1994. It is a small code base which was critical to the modding community since it enabled enthusiast to compile and inject their own maps into Doom.\\
