Migrating from Borland C++ editor on DOS to TextEdit on NeXT Step was a bittersweet experience. On one side convenient things such as syntax highlighting were lost. On the other side, the machine never crashes and developers never had to curse over hours lost. The high resolution (1120 x 832) allowed to see full function vertically and three DOS windows horizontally. \\
