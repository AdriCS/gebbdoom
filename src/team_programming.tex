Migrating from Borland C++ editor on DOS to TextEdit on NeXTSTEP was a trade-off. On one side convenient things such as syntax highlighting were lost. On the other side, the machine and the app never crashed, work was never lost. TextEdit also had the ability to parse C and "fold" function to improve readability.\\

 The high resolution (1120 x 832) allowed to see full function vertically and three DOS windows horizontally. In the next two screenshots, notice how Borland C++ can only show 21 lines of useful information while TextEdit could show XXX lines.\\

\subsection{Interface Builder}
The list of tool would not be complete without mentioning the crown jewel, Application Builder. 
Created by Jean-Marie Hullot. Coupled with Project Builder and Objective-c (never crash send message to null).\footnote{Source: "NeXT vs Sun: A world of a difference", 1991 promotional video}

\fq{In my 20 years in this industry, I have never seen a revolution as profound as [object-oriented-programming]. You can build software literally 5 to 10 times faster, and that software is much more reliable, much easier to maintain and much more powerful... All software will be written using this object technology someday. No question about it.}{Steve Job, Rolling Stone, June 16, 1994.}
