\section{Architecture}
The architecture of Doom engine is a complete departure from Wolfenstein 3D. id had to come up with a system allowing to develop on NextStep and build on MS-DOS with as little friction as possible. The solution they came up with was to have a "kernel" common to all platforms tapping into sub-systems specific to the hardware they supported.\\

\par
The kernel six sub-systems are:\\
\par
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\item
\item
\item
\item
\item
\end{enumerate}
To implement this system, they exploited the C language ability to declare in a header file (\cw{.h}) a library interface that will only be available later. Each components, the core and all systems for the target plateform are compiled independently during a first step. The C linker combine all object files into an executable (in the case of MS-DOS \cw{DOOM.EXE}).\\
\par
TODO, example with kernel.c, video.h, audio.h. video.c and audio.c.\\ 
\par
Doom ASM improved performances by 16\%. Detail here the method (timedemo) and realtick. FPS 14 to 16.\\

\trivia{
Doom build time\\ 
Full build = 9:37 (among it: 19s to link)\\
Partial build (r\_sky.c) = 27s (among it 19s to link).\\}
\par

Abstraction layer (compare VGA in wolf3d to doom) incured small overhead but also unlocked new algorithm and allowed easy port -> even a fridge runs doom.\\
\par
NextStep dithering.\\

\trivia{The MS-DOS source code features what should have been a Doom easter egg. Files \cw{am\_oids.h} and \cw{am\_oids.c} were to allow player to play a remake of Asteroids in the automap but was left unfinished.}\\
\par
\fq{I canâ€™t recall whose idea it was, but it was probably mine.  I was taken by the vector art style of the automap, so Asteroids would have been a good fit, but Doom was behind, and the pace of development at id was incredibly fast.}{Dave Taylor}
