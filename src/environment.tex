The PC environment had morphed significantly between the development of Wolfenstein 3D in 1991 and the development of Doom in 1993. To understand the shift it is easier to break the machine down in sub-systems:\\

Before describing each components in details, it is important to remind the reader that despite its improvements, the IBM PC of 1993 was not something built for 3D video games. These were machine originally designed to do word processing, spreadsheet and sometimes display a nice static image or graph. The builders never had in mind something refreshing the screen at 70Hz.\\
\par Each elements in the machine attested of the original intend, with a CPU very good at doing the wrong thing, a VGA with no double buffering capabilities and a primitive sound emitter only capable of one pitch. Any sane programmer would have ran away from a machine so ill-fated. This is what the few courageous developers of the time had to deal with.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item The reigning CPU was not longer the 386. Intel's 486 was becoming the standard.
\item RAM prices had dropped significantly. The standard 2 MiB was not a whooping 4 MiB. 
\item Bandwidth hungry GUI and had lead motherboard manufacturers to come up with a faster bus called VLB.
\item The sound generator ecosystems was even more fragmented than before with more and more manufacturer producing sound cards.
\item Not visible on the drawing, the operating system shortcomings were being addressed by independent developers via something called "DOS eXtenders".
\item Unsurprisingly the impossible to program VGA was still the standard but manufacturers were now competing to produce the faster DACs and \fixme{"RAMDAC"}?.
\item 
\end{enumerate}

The consumer machine had new CPUs, new Bus, new Sound Cards. The machine were almost twice as powerful as the year before. The development environment had also changed with powerful workstation, compilers and DOS extenders. id Software made the audacious decision to start from a clean sheet.\\
