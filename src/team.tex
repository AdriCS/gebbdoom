The development of Doom started as soon as id Software shipped Wolfenstein 3D in May, 1992. While a part of the team worked on Wolfenstein 3D Hint Manual and Spear of Destiny (using the same game engine), an other part went into research mode. The result was Shadowcaster engine which introduced diminished lightning and floor/ceiling texturing. Given the time constraints, and the scope of what they were attemtping to do, the team of four almost tripled in size.\\

In January of 1995, Electronic Games magazine ran a series of three articles for the release of Doom II. An opportunity to gather all members of id team in the group photo shown above. In the back row, left to right: Kevin Cloud, American Mcgee, John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, Sandy Petersen. Front row: Dave Taylor, John Romero and Shawn Green.\\

The plank in the photo is in fact John Romero's office door. The hole in it is the making of John Carmack involving what John Romero is holding in the photo on the right.\\

\fq{Well, Romero's doom jammed one day. He was in his office and was trapped in there,
and we couldn't get the door open. It was after-hours, so we couldn't call building
maintenance, and we were all standing around trying to figure out what to do, when
it occurred to me and I said, "You know, I do have a batle axe in my office."\\

\fq{On the first day. each guy chose his space. Carmack and Romero took side-by-side offices, while Adrian and Kevin, who were growing increasingly close, decided to share a space. Tom liked an open corner spot in a large room with a window. "This would be a great office area," he said, "we just need to put some walls up." The rest agreed. But the walls were slow to come. When- ever Tom asked Jay about it, Jay would say they were on their way. Out of humor and frustration, Tom put down two long strips of masking tape where the walls of what he called his creative corner would go.}{David Kushner, Masters of Doom}

\section{music}
fq{“Much of what was in Doom Bible never appeared in the game, but it set a mood for starting on the project. Within a few months of receiving that document, I had roughed out a lot of music and most of what turned out to be final sound effects.”}{Bobby Prince, Retro Gamer 44.}

In a baffling move, Doom (2005), the film did not tap into those now-famous Sound Ideas effects. except for the scene that most folks deem to be the best in the film.\\

\section{Distribution}
\fq{We don’t care if you make money off this shareware demo,” Jay told retailers. “Move it. Move it in mass quantities.” The retailers couldn’t believe their ears, no one had ever told them not to pay royalties.
But Jay was insistent. “Take DOOM for nothing, keep the profit. My goal is distribution. DOOM is going to
be Wolfenstein on steroids, and I want it far and wide.
I want you to stack DOOM high. In fact, I want you to
do advertising for it, too, because you’re going to make money off it. So take this money that you might have given me in royalties and use it to advertise the fact that you’re selling DOOM.}{Jay}

\trivia{The credit screen evolved with each beta version of Doom. Notice how NeXT computer were originally credited, witnessing how important the development machine were to id. In version 1.25, Michael Abrash (who would only join id for Quake) was credited due to the quality of his article in XXX and Graphic Black Book ???.}\\
