% Everything, from walls to floors and ceiling would textured. 
\subsection{Sprites}
Given the ambitons, there was a lot of artwork to produce. Weapons were animated when firing. Monsters had to have eight poses depending on the viewing angle. Wall surfaces walls, ceilings, and floors were to be textured. Not to mention all the "utility" art for the menus. intermission and final screens. It was an immense undertaking for a team of only two artists working with just Deluxe Paint.\\
\par
%They solved the problem with an interesting combinations of skills, hard work, money and guile.\\
Monsters represented most of the workload. Drawing one once with facing the player was easy. Drawing it seven more times at increasing angle (45$^{\circ}$, 90$^{\circ}$, 135$^{\circ}$, 180$^{\circ}$, 225$^{\circ}$, 270$^{\circ}$, and 315$^{\circ}$) for each actions was hell. To solve this problem they created a new process, leveraging both their artistic talent and the technological power of the NeXTDimension. First they drew it on paper, then they applied clay on a Wooden Manikin to bring it to life.\\

Once the character was carved they could change the pose at will. They only had to connect a Handycam Hi8 Sony video camera to the NextDimension. Placed on a spinner, the clay model was lighted and digitized from eight view points. It was a much faster and a funnier process.\\
\par
The output from the NeXTDimension was a 24-bit TrueColor image which had to be transformed to the doom palette\footnote{See the \doom~palette on p\ref{doom_palette}.} of 256 colors via a tool called the "Fuzzy Pumper Palette Shop". To complete each sprite, artists performed manual touchups with Deluxe Paint.\\

The process was not without it own flaws since the clay dried and had a tendency to break instead of fold. Nonetheless, seven Doom characters were built as sculptures for Doom \& Doom II. The first models - the Doomguy, Baron of Hell and Cyberdemon -- were all sculpted by Adrian Carmack.\\
\par
\trivia{Most models survived. Some are still in John Romero possession while others are visible at id Software headquarters. A few models managed to escape in the wild and are now highly priced by collectors.}

Using clay models was faster than drawing by hand but it was still not fast enough to produce the many monsters necessary. It was also limited in terms of textures since is was unable to render specular material such as metal. There were also issues with intricate details which were way too fine to survive clay modeling. They needed better models, possibly motion stop capable.\\
\par
Don Ivan Punchatz who had been commissioned for the Doom package art and logo mentioned he had a son doing exactly that. Greg had been successful providing stop animation models for big Hollywood production such as \textit{A Nightmare on Elm Street 2}, \textit{RoboCop} and its sequels, and \textit{Coming to America}. \\
\par
Kevin Cloud got in touch with Greg Punchatz and the young artist was promptly commissioned for the Arch-vile, Mancubus, Revenant and Spiderdemon.\\

\fq{The spider creature was made out of parts I had literally just found at hardware and hobby stores, pieces of Tupperware and PVC pipes. The main body started out as a sculpture, then a plaster mold was pulled from that. Then we made the armature to fit that mold, and then foam latex was injected inside the mould and put into an oven.\\
\par
Mastermind's legs pretty much only just moved, and his arms moved, but his mouth didn't move. As we went along, the other maquettes become full ball and socket armatures, so they had a full range of motion. In some ways, these stop-motion maquettes are easier to get right than they would be in CG. You don't have to worry about how your skin is weighted on stop-motion model because it just sticks to the metal armature.}{Greg Punchatz, Interview by develop-online.net Feb 16, 2016}\\

\fq{At one stage id offered me points on the backend to take \$500 off the price of one of the characters and I turned that down. It's a painful lesson. But to be part of something that has left a long-lasting impression on the world is kind of crazy -- people find out that I worked on Doom and it's like I played on the Beatles' White Album.}{Greg Punchatz, Interview by develop-online.net Feb 16, 2016}

\subsection{Weapons}
The weapons starting point were mostly toys, digitized with NeXTDimension and heavily cleaned up via Deluxe Paint.\\
\par
 The shotgun was in fact the "TootsieToy Dakota" cap shotgun, manufactured by the Strombecker Corporation of America.\\
\par
\cfullimage{Doomshotgun.png}{TootsieToy Dakota. The thing had a rifle fire mode.}
\par
The chainsaw was a real, fully functionnal, McCulloch Eager Beaver. It was borrowed from Tom Halls's girlfriend.\\
\par

\par
Luckily it was only brought in after Romero locked himself in his office. That could have been interesting.\\
\par
\trivia{The chainsaw worked well but it was leaking oil abundantly. They had to store it on top of a bowl on the ground.}\\

The chaingun was also a Tootsietoy toy called the Ol' Painless. To the delight of many parents it was able to produce loud firing sounds when connected to a 9V battery.

The fist were actually Kevin Cloud's wearing a knuckle duster. The Plasma rifle was based on the grenade launcher of a Rambo III M-60 toy set (upper left element in the box).

Since the player was to travel to several satellites of Mars during the game, matching SKY textures had to be produced.\\
\par In order to generate the "real" touch they wanted, Kevin and Adrian bought a set of 10 royalty free CD-ROM called MediaClips. Each CD had a theme (Jets, Majestic Places, Props,Wild Places, Worldview) and the wooping 650MiB capacity allowed one hundred high resolution (640x480) photos per CD.\\

 Since they did not have much time for Episode I which had to ship with the shareware in December, they simply cropped Yangshuo Cavern from China to the sky standard 256x128 resolution.  With more time for the other episodes they became more creative and composed from numerous sources. Phobos, Deimos and Hell skylines ended up borrowing to places like China, Zion, and Hawaii. \\
\par

Because the sky repeats four time in the engine, the texture had to be patched in order to wrap on their edges. Notice how right edge and left edge can be connected without discontinuities.\\
