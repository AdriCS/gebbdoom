\subsection{Breaking Away from Orthogonal Walls}

\fq{It’s not a really supercritical aspect of it, but it is interesting that when I did the early work on BSPs, Bruce Naylor came down and visited here and gave me copies of a bunch of his papers. It’s interesting to talk to people about the old days. Of course, you’ve got the Internet now. You can find anything nowadays. But back then, it was really something to get reprints of old academic papers. There were some clearinghouses I used to use: you’d pay twenty-five dollars or whatever, and they’d mail you xeroxes of old research papers. It was just a very, very different world. I learned most of my programming when I had a grand total of like three reference books. You had to figure everything else yourself. So I was finding I was reinventing a lot of classic things, like Huffman encoding or LZW encoding. So I’d be all proud of myself for having figured something out, and then I’d find it was just classic method and they did it better than I did.}{John Carmac, Interview for Scarydarkfast}
