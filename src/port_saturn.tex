Development of the Sega Saturn started in June 1992\footnote{Source: "Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle That Defined a Generation".} as a replacement for the insanely popular yet aging Genesis. At this point in time, the Genesis had sold more than 30 million units and had a "cool" image among the 15-25 range - an image built with many good games and massive TV advertising campaigns. For Sega, It was a colossal yet mandatory undertaking to at least match its predecessor.\\

After two years of hard work, Sega demonstrated a prototype Saturn during the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994. Unknown to them, it would cause even more damage than the 32X, ruin Sega International's image, and sell poorly.\\
\par
During its development, Sega worked in partnership with Hitachi to develop a new CPU tailored to its needs. The joint venture resulted in the "SuperH RISC Engine" (a.k.a SH-2) at the end of 1993 which Sega used in dual configuration as foundation for the Saturn.\\
\par
 On the graphics side, one video display processor (VDP) was to do most of the job. However reports of the PlayStation's capabilities prompted Sega to add a second VDP to improve the system's 2D performance and texture-mapping.\\

Sega managed to release its console before the dreaded PSX and sales in Japan were initially promising with games such as Daytona USA and especially Virtua Fighter being well received. The initial success had a lot to do with Virtua Fighter which was by far the most popular arcade game in Japan at the time\footnote{Source: "Virtua Fighter Mania". GamePro. No. 89. February 1996.  p28.}.\\
\par
Beating Sony came at a great price and the result seemed rushed. During E3 1995 in Los Angeles, Sega CEO Tom Kalinske surprise-announced that the Saturn would be available the very same day. Even their supplier did not know about this and the console was out of stock rapidly. Another consequence of the rush was that only six games were available upon launch. Panzer Dragoon, which could have made for a perfect flagship title, missed its deadline\footnote{Source: "The Making Of... Panzer Dragoon Saga", \cw{nowgamer.com}.}.\\
\par The machine was also difficult to program. 3D was achieved in a similar way to the 3DO. Programmers had to deal with 2D quads which could be distorted in screen space to poorly fake perspective. It was not a matter of not trying hard, the hardware was complex.\\

\par
Worldwide, the platform had a lukewarm reception. And then the beast was unleashed.\\
\par
 Two weeks after release, the PSX came out with Ridge Racer and took the world by storm\footnote{The PlayStation outsold the Saturn by a factor of three.}. Not only was the Saturn more expensive (\$399) than the PSX (\$299), games such as Daytona USA which used to look good now had blatant issues when put side-by-side with Ridge Racer. The lower framerate, polygon pop-up and letter-boxed presentation begged for mercy. To add more pressure, in June 1996 the market welcomed another competitor with the Nintendo 64.\\
\par
% Ironically Sega's next console, the DreamCast addressed all issues.  It was easy to program, ran on Windows and was very well liked by developers.
Eventually, several good games were released but the damage had been done. More issues kept adding up. The copy protection was hacked early on. Electronic Arts refused to release its popular E.A. Sports games on the platform. With the release of the XBox and the PS2, Sega found itself technically outgunned. With the failure of both the 32X and then the Saturn, Sega bled money for years. In late 2001, and on the verge of bankruptcy, Sega decided to withdraw from the hardware business and focus on producing games on its successful "Virtua" line of products. Ironically Sega's last console, the Dreamcast, was highly regarded by both programmers and players.


\subsection{Programming the Saturn}
Programming the Saturn was a difficult task. The programmer's manual is broken down into eight voluminous manuals requiring repeat reading sessions to build a mental image of the flow of data. The diagram in figure \ref{arch_saturn} gives some idea of the daunting effort.\\
\par
Main programming was done via the SH-2 processors connected to 1.5MiB of shared RAM. One SH-2 was deemed the master and the other the slave. In the common configuration, the slave was intended to be used as a helper for parallelizable tasks. Communication between chips (to indicate what to execute) had to be done via a tedious interrupt system. To deal with static and global variables the programmer had to deal with mutexes and semaphores which were uncommon concepts for game console programmers. Because they were on the same bus, one had to wait for the other if both needed to access either to RAM or a peripheral on the system. Attempts to minimize the issue were made via a shared unified 4KiB cache that had little impact on the bottleneck.\\
\par
Audio was done via the SCSP (Saturn Custom Sound Processor) that piloted a sound processor (a Motorola 68000). The SCSP was to be configured to perform sound mixing in the dedicated 512 KiB of RAM, which was then picked up by the Sound Processor. The combination of these made it a powerful system able to synthesize instruments, play PCM sound and perform 3D effects/distortion. The chip also polled control inputs from the player and stored them in internal registers to be polled by the SH-2s.\\
\par
Graphics programming was done via two chips called VDP1 and VDP2. At the beginning of a frame, the VDP1 plots part of the active framebuffer on the basis of commands and bitmaps in the VRAM. Once done, the active framebuffer is labeled a "passive framebuffer". The VDP2 takes the passive framebuffer, adds background-based scroll panes and sends it to the TV. Note that the two chips work in parallel. While the VDP1 works on the next frame, the VDP2 finishes the previous one.\\
\par
Access to the CD-ROM was done via a driver piloting the SH-1 processor. The double-speed unit could read at 150 KiB/s but average access time was 300 ms. To compensate, the SH-1 stored data to a 512KiB buffer. Based on the abysmal access time, programmers were instructed to request data well in advance.\\ 
\par
To control all these components and transfer data between systems, a seventh chip called the SCU (System Control Unit) acted as DMA controller, DSP and bus controller. The DSP was able to perform matrix transformations and write the result directly in the VDP RAM.\\
\par


\trivia{Reading the programmer manual in detail reveals that each component can somehow interact with each others' RAM. This made debugging very difficult.}

Despite its issues and ill-timed release, it is a bitter feeling to see what happened to the Saturn and seeing it considered a failure. Over its four years of life, the platform managed to host amazing technical and entertaining games such as Radiant Silvergun, Grandia, Sega Rally Championship, Virtua Fighter 2, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Guardian Heroes, NiGHTS into Dreams, Panzer Dragoon II Zwei and Virtua Cop. Unfortunately, \doom{} would not be part of the previous list.\\

\subsection{Doom on Saturn}
The port to the Saturn was done by Rage Software on a very tight schedule. Like most ports, it is based on the Jaguar assets. The console had the same technical shortcomings when it comes to texture sampling, as Jim Bagley remembers\footnote{RetroGamer \#134.}:\\
\par
\fq{When I started the project, I had to do a demo for id Software to approve. I started by extracting all the levels and audio and textures from the WAD files and made my own Saturn version of this, then got an early version of the renderer working using the 3D hardware. This got sent off and a couple days later I got a call from John Carmack, who stipulated that under no circumstances could I use the 3D hardware to draw the screen. I had to use the processor like the PC. Thankfully I enjoy challenges, so it turned out to be a really enjoyable project, using both SH2s to render the display like the PC did it, using the 68000 to orchestrate them both.\\
\par
However, it kneecapped the game and the speed-framerate suffered greatly.}{Jim Bagley for RetroGamer \#134}\\
\par
Years later, by 2014, Carmack had reconsidered.\\
\par
\fq{I hated affine texture swim and integral quad verts, but in hindsight, I probably should have let experiment.}{John Carmack}\\
\par
The hardware-accelerated 60 FPS-capable engine was tossed. Due to time constraints, Jim did not have the time to change the renderer to work with pixel-wide triangles like the PlayStation. Upon shipping, the game managed a framerate that could reach 20 FPS but most of the time this dropped to the single digits at a full screen resolution of 281x235. To compensate for the low framerate, Jim Bagley made the decision to slow down all movements, a move that enraged the playing community.\\
\par
\trivia{Another effect of the rushed schedule was a pretty big bug with the audio system that made all sound effects panned left. Players were forced to play in mono to hear from both speakers.\footnote{Digital Foundry: "Every Console Port Tested and Analysed!".}}







\fullimage{doom_saturn1.png}\\
\par
In the screenshot above, notice how E1M1 is the same as other console versions (all based on the initial work for the Jaguar). The status bar however welcomed a makeover.\\
\par
To take advantage of the VDP's parallelism, it is claimed\footnote{Digital Foundry: "Every Console Port Tested and Analysed!".} the VDP1 is used to render sprites and walls while the VDP2 is used for the status bar and also renders visplanes which are treated as background.\\
\par 
Translucency was done in a peculiar way. It is unknown if this was a design decision, a hardware limitation or simply due to time constraints, but translucency is not done via alpha blending like the Playstation did. A more software-friendly technique known as dithering is used to represent the spectres and glass surfaces (see page \pageref{doomsaturndither}).\\
% \fq{The Saturn had to be programmed straight to the metal. It used quads and messy 3D maths.}{David Shea, Alien Trilogy developer}
\par
% Despite heroic efforts from the team, time constraints hurt the final quality. The game was universally disliked and labeled as the second worse port of doom (right after the 3DO).\\
