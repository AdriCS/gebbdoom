Development of the Sega Saturn started in June 1992\footnote{Source: "Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle That Defined a Generation".} as a replacement for the insanely popular yet aging Genesis. At this point in time, the Genesis has sold more than 30 millions units and had a "cool" image build with many good games and massive TV advertising campaigns. It was a colossal yet mandatory undertaking to at least match its predecessor.\\
\par
After two years of hard work, Sega announced the Saturn during Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994. Unknown to them, it would trigger the collapse of Sega International sales and image.\\
\par
During its development, Sega worked in partnership with Hitachi to develop a new CPU tailored to its needs. The join venture resulted in the "SuperH RISC Engine" (a.k.a SH-2) at the end of 1993 which Sega used in dual configuration as foundation for the Saturn.\\
\par
 On the graphic side, one video display processor (VDP) was to do most of the job. However reports of the PlayStation capabilities prompted Sega to add a second VDP to improve the system's 2D performance and texture-mapping.\\

Sega had managed to release before the dreaded PSX and sales were initially promising. Games such as Daytona USA and especially Virtua Fighter were well received. The success was exceptionally strong in Japan where Virtua Fighter was more popular than Sonic, Mario, and Tetris\footnote{Source: 2006 poll for Top 100 games.}.\\
\par
The console only had six games upon release and despite being reasonably priced \$399, it was still more expensive than the PSX. As it would turn out it was also less powerful.\\
\par
 Two weeks after release, the PSX came out with Ridge Racer and took the world by storm. Games such as Daytona USA which used to look good now had blatant issues when put side by side with Ridge Racer. The lower framerate, polygon pop-up and letter-boxed presentation begged for mercy.\\
\par
The fatal mistake of Sega was that its console was not well equipped for 3D games which everybody now wanted. The hardware was a modified last-generation 2D system which was rapidly outgunned first by the PlayStation, then by the Nintendo 64 in June 1996.

Rushed release to undercut PlayStation. Developers not given enough time (only six games at launch). Even suppliers were taken by surprise. 1995 saw improvement with Virtua Cop and Virtua Fighte 2 but mostly in Japan  But PlayStation sold 3x more. In June 1996 an other competitor Nintendo64 achieved the Saturn.

Rushed release.\\
Panzer Dragoon missed their deadline\footnote{Source: "The Making Of... Panzer Dragoon Saga".}.
Supply issues. Same day announcement made the console scarce.

\subsection{Doom on Saturn}
Port to the Saturn was done by Rage Software, starting from the PlayStation version (itself based on the Jaguar). The console had the same technical fallout when it came to texture sampling as remembers Jim Bagley.\\
\par
\fq{When I started the project, I had to do a demo for id Software to approve. I started by extrating all the levels and audio and textures from the WAD files and made my own Saturn version of this, then got an early version of the renderer working using the 3D hardware. The got sent off and a couple days later I for a call from John Carmack, who stipulated that under no circunstances could I use the 3D harware to draw the screen. I had to use the processor like the PC. Thankfully I enjoy challenges, so it turned out to be a really enjoyable project, using both SH2s to render the display like the PC did it, using the 68000 to orchestrate them both.
\par
However, it kneecapped the game and the speed-framerate suffered greatly.}{Jim Bagley for RetroGamer \#134}\\
\par
Years later, in 2014, Carmack had reconsidered.\\
\par
\fq{I hated affine texture swim and integral quad verts, but in hindsight, I probably should have let experiment.}{John Carmack}\\
\par
The hardware accelerated sixty fps engine was tossed. Due to time constraints, Jim did not have the time to change the renderer to work with one pixel wide triangles like the PlayStation. Wihtout assisntace from the VDP chips, the Saturn was an overclocked X32. The game managed a framerate of 10-15 fps at a full screen resolution of 281x235. To compensate for the low framerate, designers of the game slowed down all movement which was frowned upon by the player community.\\
\par
\trivia{An other effect of the rushed schedule was a pretty big bug with the audio system which made all sound effects to be panned left. Players were forced to play in mono to hear from both speakers.\footnote{Digital Foundry: "Every Console Port Tested and Analysed!".}}\\
