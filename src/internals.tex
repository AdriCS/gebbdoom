It took ten months to write this book from October 2017 to July 2018. That was pleasant. Then it took three months to proof-read it. That was very unpleasant.\\
\par
I worked on it whenever I could find the time on evenings and weekends, but mostly favoring the 7am to 9am slot. The text was written with Sublime Text 3.0 and compiled with \cw{pdflatex}. The \cw{.pdf} can be built with a single command. \\
\par
\tcode{compile.txt}
\par
To improve compilation time, \cw{book.tex} is a simple list of \cw{\textbackslash subfile} commands. Based on which section of the book was being worked on, other lines were commented. This decreased the build time from several minutes to a few seconds.\\
\par
 Drawings were made with Inkscape, saved to \cw{.svg} and converted to \cw{.eps} to incorporate nicely with \cw{pdflatex} compiler. Screenshots were cleaned up with Adobe Photoshop CC. The font used is Computer Modern Sans Serif, size 10pts.\\

A few numbers...\\
