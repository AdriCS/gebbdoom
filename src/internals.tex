It took one year to make this book, mostly on evenings and weekends, from October 2017 to December 2018. The text was written with Sublime Text 3.0 and compiled with \cw{pdflatex}. The \cw{.pdf} can be built with a single command.\\
\par
\tcode{compile.txt}
\par
To improve compilation time, \cw{book.tex} is a simple list of \cw{\textbackslash subfile} commands. Based on which section of the book was being worked on, other lines were commented. This decreased the build time from several minutes to a few seconds.\\
\par
 Drawing were made with InkScape, saved to \cw{.svg} and converted to \cw{.eps} to be incorporated nicely with \cw{pdflatex} compiler. Screenshots were cleaned up with Adobe Photoshop CC. The font used is Computer Modern Sans Serif, size 10pts.\\
