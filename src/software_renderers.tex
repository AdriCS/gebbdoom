\section{Renderers}
With the graphic stack in mind, it is now time to dive inside the rendition routine, \cw{D\_Display} which contains every renderers in the game.\\
\par
\ccode{D_Display.c}\\
\par
 There are several 2D renderers (called "Drawer" in the code) and one 3D renderer. Different portions of \cw{D\_Display} are enable via a switch case depending on \cw{gamestate}.\\
 \par
  Most Drawers are requested to draw before 3D view, then comes the \cw{HUD} (the text indicating what was picked up) and finally the menu on top of everything else if it is visible.
