\section{Renderers}
With the graphic stack in mind, it is now time to dive inside the rendition routine, \cw{D\_Display} which contains every renderers in the game.\\
\par
\ccode{D_Display.c}\\
\par
 There are several 2D renderers (called "Drawer" in the code) and one 3D renderer. Different portions of \cw{D\_Display} are enable depending on \cw{gamestate}.\\
 \par
  The way 2D renderers and 3D renderers work together is via a painter algorithm. Most 2D elements are requested to draw first, then comes the turn of the 3D view, then the \cw{HUD} (the text indicating what was picked up) and finally the menu on top of everything if it is visible.\\
