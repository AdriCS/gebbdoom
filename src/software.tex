\section{Source Code}
DOOM source code was released on December 23, 1997\footnote{Four years after the commercial release on December 10, 1993}. More than twenty years later, the zip archive is still where it was placed, on id Softare ftp server.\\

 In the long series of id software source code release, Doom source code stands apart since what was released was not what was used to ship the game. The source code is targeted at neither MS-DOS nor NextStep. There is a little bit of a backstory about how this code ended up being released.\\
 \par
 In early 1997, Bernd Kreimeier (a programmer and professional author) approached id software in order to write a book explaining the Doom game engine internals and how to extend/modify the game. The idea was to release the book with the source code. After obtaining the MS-DOS/NextStep source code, he had to face a dilemma. Due to copyright issue, the DMX source code could not be included. Unwilling to release something that would no compile his other option was to release the NextStep version. However since NeXT had stopped manufacturing workstation in 1994 and sold less than 50,000 units over its lifetime this version would have been useless. His solution to provides something compiling out of the box and reaching sa many readers as possible was to remove the portions of the code targetting MS-DOS, Irix, and NeXT components and port Doom to Linux.\\
\par
 As he was writing both the code required by Linux and the explanations for the book, hardware and software kept on evolving. Things evolved faster than he could write and before he could finish Doom had became obsolete. With the profitability of the project compromised, and with the blessing of id Software, Kreimeier released his Linux port. This port became the base of all hundreds of ports ever generated since.\footnote{The original MS-DOS code can largely be reconstructed thanks to Raven which was much less conservative about DMX overlaps. Large portions of previously censured system of the game such as \cw{i\_sounc.c} were found in Heretic, and Hexen source code.}.\\
