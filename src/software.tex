\section{Source Code}
The source code of \doom was released roughtly four years after the commercial release of the game, on December 23, 1997. More than twenty five years later, the zip archive is still where it was originally placed, on id Software ftp server.\\

 In the long series of id software source code release\footnote{From 1993 to 20XX, id Software released the code for all nine games it produced}, Doom source code stands apart since what was released was not what was used to ship the game. The source code is targeted at neither MS-DOS nor NextStep. There is a little bit of a back story about how this code ended up being released.\\
 \par
 In early 1997, Bernd Kreimeier approached id software. He wanted to write a book explaining the interns of Doom game engine and tutorial on how to modify it. The idea was to release the book along with the source code.\\
 \par
  id Software agreed this was a good idea. However, upon receiving the source code, Bernd had to make a few important decisions. Dave Taylor had been hard at work and \doom was able to run on many platforms.  It could be compiled for DOS, NextStep, IRIX SGI, and Linux. To make the code easier to understand, he decided to pick one platform and delete everything unrelated.\\
  \par
  Because the dominant operating system was MS-DOS, it would have made sense to pick that target. However, due to copyright issues, the DMX source library needed by the MS-DOS build could not be included. MS-DOS was a no-go.\\
   An other option would have been to release the NextStep version. However since NeXT had stopped manufacturing workstation in 1994 and sold less than 50,000 units over its lifetime this was also a dead end. The third best solution was to elect the Linux build.\\
\par
 As he was cleaning up the code from everything not related to Linux and writing the book at the same time, hardware and software kept on evolving. Things evolved faster than he could write and before he could finish Doom had became obsolete.\\
 \par
  With the profitability of the project compromised the book was abandoned\footnote{What a pity, what remains, a PDF titled "XXX" is of great quality.}. With the blessing of id Software, Kreimeier decided to release the code he had cleaned up. This port became the base of all hundreds of ports ever generated since.\footnote{The original MS-DOS code can largely be reconstructed thanks to Raven which was much less conservative about DMX overlaps. Large portions of previously censured system of the game such as \cw{i\_sound.c} and \cw{i\_ibm.c} can be found in Heretic, and Hexen source code.}.\\
