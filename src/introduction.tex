DOOM, the game, needs little introduction. Released in December 1993, it went on to become one of the best game of all time. Almost everything about the game has been written. DOOM, the game engine, despite an attempt in 195 was never documented in a book. Some of the design decision were never explained. This is the missing link this book tries to cover.\\
