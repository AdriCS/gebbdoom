\section{Network}
The early 90s predated the wide adoption of the Internet and WiFI. Connecting computers together was difficult and expensive\footnote{Computer-to-computer games existed since the early 1980s. Some were even cross-platform, such as Battle Chess.}. Even if you had the means, bandwidth and latency were abysmal. Most of the time, playing with friends meant getting all computers into the same room (a LAN party). Playing from the comfort of your room was extremely uncommon. Amusingly, an unconnected computer is now deemed useless. Communication with other machines is something natural and the bare minimum for a machine to be useful.\\
\par
 But back in the early 90s, to pack your 50lb machine (including the CRT) on your bike, make it to a friend's place alive, plug in the cables, start \doom{} and finally see your character move on the other computer screen was an indescribable feeling. To witness machines actually communicating felt unreal and almost magical.\\
\par 
To achieve the impossible, players had three technologies available: Null-Modem cables, Modems, and LAN via Network cards.









\subsection{Null-Modem Cable}
The cheapest way and what most people used was the \$20 cable known as a "Null-Modem" cable which was directly plugged in each PC's COM port. The cable offered no (hence the name) modulation at all and only two players could participate.\\
\par

\par
 Two players may sound lame by today standards but back then it was so new and cool that it felt like the most amazing thing in the world.







\subsection{BNC 10Base2 LAN (Local Area Network)}
To play with more than one opponent was substantially more difficult. Besides the relatively easy financial burden to pay for the equipment, you had to overcome the much more difficult task to convince a parent to let four teenagers come to their house where they would scream all night. The famous saying: "Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me" is rumored to have originated from betrayed mothers and fathers whom had been \textit{doomed} all night.\\

Leaving creative ways to ask for forgiveness aside, on the technical side a player had to plug in a 10Base2 network card via the ISA bus. \\
\par The card had a BNC connector upon which was to be plugged a T-shaped connector known as a T-piece. Each PC node was connected to up to two other nodes via a 10Base2 coaxial cables. There was no central point in this type of networking, all machines involved in the network formed a chain. At both ends the chain had to end in a signal terminator to prevent an RF signal from being reflected back from each end, causing interference, or power loss.

\scaledimage{.5}{BNC_connector_50_ohm_male}
\end{wrapfigure}
The coaxial cables were bulky and so were the connectors. Connecting an end to a T-piece connector was fully achieved with a cool quarter turn of the coupling nut.\\
\par
 Once physically connected, there was no configuration required (IPX is a network level protocol like Ethernet). The network cards' MAC addresses were enough to run the IPX protocol which most games used.\\

Figure \ref{10base5bncConnector}  shows the the four elements of a 1994 LAN. \circled{1} the T-piece connecting two \circled{2} coaxial cables, forming a link. Each end of the chain must be closed with two load terminators \circled{3}. The network card connects to both the PC via its ISA bus extension slots (\circled{4}) and the LAN T-base slots.\\
\par
\trivia{Adding a new machine on the network meant either unplugging one of the T-shaped connector or unplugging a chain terminator. In both cases, the central bus was broken and all other machines lost connectivity. Everybody remembers the one friend who was always late to the LAN, forcing everybody to disconnect so he could join. The bandwidth was shared meaning the theoretical 10Mb/s was often closer to 5Mb/s. This does not account for friends who wanted to exchange a 30MiB song in \cw{.wav} format (there was no mp3 at the time).}\\
\par
\trivia{Really fancy people could use a 10baseT network which requires a "hub" central device resulting in a star shaped network.}









\subsection{Modem}
The most fortunate players were able to afford the luxury of networking from home. That was very expensive since they not only had to pay for a modem and a subscription to an Internet provider monthly but they also had to pay for the time spent online.\\
\par 
Before broadband, modems used phone landlines to connect to the Internet provider. The result was that nobody could use the telephone while the connection was active. Anybody picking up the phone in the house created enough disturbance to kill the connection.\\
\par
AOL (America OnLine) offered a package of five hours for \$9.95 with each extra hour billed \$3.50 per unit. A player averaging 2h/day could be billed $9.95 + 55 * 3.5 = \$202 $ for a month\footnote{Adjusted to inflation: \$352 in 2018.}. Add the price of a fast 9600 baud model for \$399\footnote{Adjusted to inflation: \$696 in 2018.} and you get a good idea of how much it cost for be able to post text messages on a BBS (Bulletin board system).\\

 While establishing the initial handshake the modem speaker was kept open. An attuned ear could easily recognize the different phases where V.X bis transaction, speed negotiation, echo canceller disabling, and modulation modes selection together making the unforgeable melody of a deathmatch in the making.\\

Throughout the 90s, the bandwidth kept on steadily improving. Upon \doom{}'s release most modems were capable of 28.8 kbit/s. Those who downloaded the shareware version in December 1993 had to wait 12.5 minutes to collect the (2,166,955 bytes) of the zip archive.\\

\footnotetext{Bit rate increased at the expense of latency. A 9600 baud modem played \doom{} better than the default configurations of 56kbit modems. Quake needed more bandwidth than \doom{}'s controller replication, so it became a different tradeoff.}


\par

On top of the V.XX hardware communication layer, modems were driven using Hayes commands\footnote{A nice abstraction layer, but not all modems were the same and \doom{} has a long file with initialization parameters for 49 different modems.}. Notice how command \cw{ATDT} was translated to DTMF in the previous spectrogram.\\% in figure \ref{spectrogram2.png} on page \pageref{spectrogram2.png}.\\
