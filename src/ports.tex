The success of the PC version and its mind numbing sales figure made it an extremely desirable title for any console publisher of the early 90s. From 1994 to 1997, \doom was ported to all six major systems of the era.\\

This time period is known as the "console war" during which the generation of a system was associated to its "bitness". Third generation, 8-bit based, NES and Sega Master System had dissapeared. The fourth, 16-bit generation, made of Nintendo's SNES, TurboGrafx-16 and Sega's Genesis was reaching end of life. The fifth, 32-bit, generation 
was starting to appear with Sony's Playstation1 and Sega Saturn with marketers trying to play on words with systems branded 64-bit like the Nintendo64 or the Jaguar\footnote{After that, consumers either got tired or the "bits" or realized the silliness of the whole nomenclature. Bitness was forgotten.}.. In retrospect, it was a rich period, propice to hardware innovation which contrast vividly when compared to 2018 uniform world of Sony vs Microsoft where system only differ by their name.\\
\par
The architecture of the engine based on a core with "only" sub-system to implement may lead to conclude it was an easy task to get \doom to run on a console. This feeling could not be further from the truth. From design trade-off due to restricted resources, crazy schedules, to anecdote of a lone hero programmer trying to make the everything fit in, all versions have an unique and rich story.\\
\par
From a technical standing point, the common problem to solve was to deal with less memory than originally intended. PCs minimum requirement was to have 4 MiB installed on the machine. It was of course not possible to ask customers to add more RAM to their console. Developers sometimes had to deal little as little as 512 KiB of RAM.\\
\par
The second difficulty was to deal with exotic hardware. The PC was designed around one "big iron" CPU while consoles were a made of a constellation of processors.

Biggest mistake: "designing the Saturn as a modified last-generation 2D system when clearly 3D was going to be the next big thing".\\
