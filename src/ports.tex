The success of the PC version and its mind numbing sales figure made it an extremely desirable title for any console publisher of the early 90s. From 1994 to 1997, \doom was ported to all six major systems of the era.\\

\par
The architecture of the engine based on a core with "only" sub-system to implement may lead to conclude it was an easy task to get \doom to run on a console. This feeling could not be further from the truth. From design trade-off due to restricted resources, crazy schedules, to anecdote of a lone hero programmer trying to make the everything fit in, all versions have an unique and rich story.\\
\par
From a technical standing point, the common problem to solve was to deal with less memory than originally intended. PCs minimum requirement was to have 4 MiB installed on the machine. It was of course not possible to ask customers to add more RAM to their console. Developers sometimes had to deal little as little as 512 KiB of RAM.\\
\par
The second difficulty was to deal with exotic hardware. The PC was designed around one "big iron" CPU while all consoles were a made of a constellation of CPUs and co-processors.

modified version of the Doom engine used in the Atari Jaguar port. This version spent six months in development. The Arch-vile monster from Doom II is not present; according to one of the game's designers, Harry Teasley, this was because he had twice as many frames as any other monster, and the team felt that they "just couldn't do him justice" on the PlayStation. A new monster however was added: Nightmare spectre (subtractively blended against the background graphics).\\
\par
 These include sector-based coloured lighting, an animated, flame-filled sky, and a new animation for the player's mug shot, which shows the Doomguy's head exploding if the player character is gibbed. translucent Spectres are drawn without the cascade effect \\
\par
r Next Generation said the PlayStation version succeeded in "putting previous efforts for 32X, Jaguar, and especially Super NES, to shame"

\fq{this was the product of ten intense weeks of work due to the fact that I was misled about the state of the port when I was offered the project. I was told that there was a version in existance with new levels, weapons and features and it only needed "polishing" and optimization to hit the market. After numerous requests for this version, I found out that there was no such thing and that Art Data Interactive was under the false impression that all anyone needed to do to port a game from one platform to another was just to compile the code and adding weapons was as simple as dropping in the art.\\
\par
Uh... No...\\
\par
My friends at 3DO were begging for DOOM to be on their platform and with christmas 1995 coming soon (I took this job in August of 1995, with a mid October golden master date), I literally lived in my office, only taking breaks to take a nap and got this port completed.\\
\par
Shortcuts made...\\
\par
I had no time to port the music driver, so I had a band that Art Data hired to redo the music so all I needed to do is call a streaming audio function to play the music. This turned out to be an excellent call because while the graphics were lackluster, the music got rave reviews.\\
\par
3DO's operating system was designed around running an app and purging, there was numerous bugs caused by memory leaks. So when I wanted to load the Logicware and id software logos on startup, the 3DO leaked the memory so to solve that, I created two apps, one to draw the 3do logo and the other to show the logicware logo. After they executed, they were purged from memory and the main game could run without loss of memory.\\
\par
There was a Electronic Arts logo movie in the data, because there was a time that EA was going to be distributing the game, however the deal fell through.\\
\par
The vertical walls were drawn with strips using the cell engine. However, the cell engine can't handle 3D perspective so the floors and ceilings were drawn with software rendering. I simply ran out of time to translate the code to use the cell engine because the implementation I had caused texture tearing.\\
\par
I had to write my own string.h ANSI C library because the one 3DO supplied with their compiler had bugs! string.h??? How can you screw that up!?!?! They did! I spent a day writing all of the functions I needed in ARM 6 assembly.}{Rebecca Ann Heineman}
