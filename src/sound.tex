\section{Sound System}
PC were equipped with a "PC Speaker", a device able to produce monotonic and annoying "beeps". The intend was to help diagnose system health at startup (one short beep meant the system was ok). But serious gamers always invested in a sound card. Thanks to its aggressive marketing, superior technology, and cheaper cards, Creative Labs dominated the market. In order to hope surviving, any newcomer had to label itself "Creative Labs compatible". The unofficial standard meant OPL2 based FM synthesize capability for music and a DSP able to playback digitized sounds at 22Khz, 8-bit per sample in stereo.\\
\par
 The early 90s were the theater of the last wave of innovation for audio gaming and saw the extinction of a previously key manufacturer named AdLib\footnote{Which ironically had established the OPL2 chipset necessity.}. Two cards nonetheless managed to bring something new to the table. They were the Sound Blaster 16 by Creative Labs and the Gravis Ultrasound by Advanced Gravis Computer Technology Ltd.\\

\subsection{Sound Blaster 16}
 In June 1992, with the release of the Sound Blaster 16, Creative Labs solved the problem of PC audio for gaming forever with a card capable of CD quality playback, 44Khz, 16-bit sample on stereo. It was an instant hit and immensely successful with customers.\\

\par
Solving the audio problem turned out to be a problem of its own for Creative Labs business. Even though they subsequently managed to release new products, those mainly interested audio professional. A few attempts to innovate with ASP, and EAX technologies were made but consumers remained deaf to the melody of these improvements. As audio chips became cheaper to make and with the technical requirements stagnating, manufacturers started to provide audio capability built-in the motherboard.\\
\par
For a short time the extra IDE connectors permitting connection of a CD-ROMs allowed sound cards to survive, in bundle products. But that was not enough to save them. Within ten years the market of audio cards disappeared.\\

\subsection{Gravis UltraSound}
Gravis Computer Technology originally built what was universally accepted as the best PC joypad, the Gravis PC GamePad. Strong with the cash flow they decided to enter the sound card market with an audacious and innovative card. The Gravis Ultrasound (nicknamed GUS) was released in 1992.\\
\par
The GUS offered Sound Blaster 16 compatible music and digitized sound playback. On top of that the card had a capability like no others one the market. It was able to play music, not with FM synthesize but with digitized instrument samples. The technology named "Wavetable Synthesis" achieved an audio quality far superior to its competitors.

The concept was aggressive and so were the hardware that came out of Gravis factories. The red resin used made their card unmistakably recognizable.\\
\par
The cost of this technology was twofold. First the card needed audio samples. This problem was "solved" via Gravis driver which installed more than 12 MiB of sound samples\footnote{That was enormous at the time, the full version of \doom{} was 12 MiB as a matter of comparison.}. Second, the card had to be able to access the sample at runtime which mean its had to have its own RAM. Since samples are much more voluminous than sin equations, the original GUS shipped with 256 KiB and could be boosted to 1 MiB.\\
\par
It rapidly developed a cult following among demo-makers who loved the high music quality it could achieve. On the lambda customer side however, things were more complicated. The GUS's GF1 main chip had difficulties emulating the OPL2 and setup was complicated (a huge TSR emulator had to be loaded manually by the user). The GUS also suffered of an unfortunate release date concurrent to the RAM shortage of 1993/1994. Players were reluctant to fork the \$169 it cost which was \$40 more than a Sound Blaster 16. With sales plummeting, Gravis almost went bankrupt.\\
\par
 id Software was one of the rare companies to support the Gravis Ultra Sound. \doom{}provided a \cw{.PAT} file which was a simple mapping of 256 values to translate FM encoded midi \cw{id} instruments to Gravis ID instruments. Listening to the electric guitars and drums of "At Doom's Gate" from Doom soundtrack makes the FM version pale in comparison. But success story must have the right timing and sadly the GUS was way ahead of its time.

 \subsection{Roland}
 Impossible to close the audio section without mentioning Roland hardware. Established in 1972, Roland Corporation not only manufactured equipment for audio playback, it also provided the best hardware to author and record music. The real breakthrough for DOS gaming was the Roland SC-55 (a.k.a SoundCanvas) released in 1991. Not only it was the very first General MIDI standard device (which defined 128 instruments that every device following the standard could adopt), it synthesized music using Roland's proprietary combination of prerecorded samples and subtractive synthesis which was far superior to Yamaha's OPL.\\
 \par

 \par

Roland's equipment was built entirely around the MIDI protocol which was carried via cables employing a special 5-pin circular connector.\\
\par
 The precursor of the SC-55, the MT-32 synthesizer could be connected to a PC via a MPU-401 ISA MIDI adapter card. There was also a combo LAPC-1 card which combined both the adapter and the synthesizer inside a single isa card.\\

Roland also released the SCC-1 which combined a SC-55 and a MPU-401 on a single ISA card.\\

\pagebreak
For recording, an artist connected a musical keyboard to a "note recording program" called a MIDI sequencer. Once captured on the computer, the midi based music could be tweaked and edited like any media.\\

\par
For playback, things were a tiny bit more complicated. When Sierra On-line pioneered support for Roland sound cards in 1988, the games leveraged the hardware to play beautiful music. The audio effects were either done via the PC Speaker or later using General Midi stock audio effects\footnote{Another World in 1991 used the stock audio effects}. As games became increasingly elaborated with PCM digitized effects (which Roland cards could not play), gamers faced a dilemma where the best music needed a Roland but the best sound effects needed either a SoundBlaster or a GUS. The expensive (\$\$\$)solution was to buy both cards and mix the stream externally.\\
