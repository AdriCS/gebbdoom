\section{doombsp}
\cw{doombsp} processes output from DoomED (XXX files) into XXX, XXX, and XXX. It was released very shorty after Doom shareware on April, 6th 1994. It is a small code base which was critical to the modding community since it enabled enthusiast to compile and inject their own maps into Doom.\\

\section{music}
fq{“Much of what was in Doom Bible never appeared in the game, but it set a mood for starting on the project. Within a few months of receiving that document, I had roughed out a lot of music and most of what turned out to be final sound effects.”}{Bobby Prince, Retro Gamer 44.}

\fq{The id Software development team originally wanted me to do nothing but metal songs for DOOM. I did not think that this type of music would be appropriate throughout the game, but I roughed out several original songs and also created MIDI sequences of some cover material. This was before any level design and was before most of the artwork had been created. As the game came together, the guys at id saw that this type of music was not appropriate for many of the levels in DOOM. Thinking that this would be the case, I had also roughed out a lot of ambient moody background music, much of which ended up in the game. This song ("At Doom's Gate") was one of the first of its type that I wrote. I heard it as being on a level that went by real fast. As it turns out, John Romero (who placed all of the songs on the levels) decided it was a perfect song for the first level.}{Bobby}

\section{Distribution}
\fq{We don’t care if you make money off this shareware demo,” Jay told retailers. “Move it. Move it in mass quantities.” The retailers couldn’t believe their ears, no one had ever told them not to pay royalties.
But Jay was insistent. “Take DOOM for nothing, keep the profit. My goal is distribution. DOOM is going to
be Wolfenstein on steroids, and I want it far and wide.
I want you to stack DOOM high. In fact, I want you to
do advertising for it, too, because you’re going to make money off it. So take this money that you might have given me in royalties and use it to advertise the fact that you’re selling DOOM.}{Jay}

\section{Programming}
Migrating from Borland C++ editor on DOS to TextEdit on NeXT Step was a bittersweet experience. On one side convenient things such as syntax highlighting were lost. On the other side, the machine never crashes and developers never had to curse over hours lost. The high resolution (1120 x 832) allowed to see full function vertically and three DOS windows horizontally. \\
