\section{Palette Effects}
 The first palette, palette 0, is used for most situations.\\ \par
  Palettes 10-12 are used (briefly) when an item is picked up, the
more items that are picked up in quick succession, the brighter it
gets, palette 12 being the brightest. \\ \par
  Palette 13 is used while wearing a radiation suit.\\ \par
  Palettes 3, 2, then 0 again are used after getting berserk strength.

  If the player is hurt, then the palette shifts up to number X, then
comes "down" one every second or so, to palette 2, then palette 0
(normal) again. What X is depends on how badly the player got hurt:
Over 100\% damage (add health loss and armor loss), X=8.\\
93\%, X=7.\\
 81\%, X=6\\
 . 55\%, X=5\\
 . 35\%, X=4\\
 . 16\%, X=2\\
 . These are just rough estimates based on a single test session long ago. Why bother tracking down the exact division points? \\ \par

  Unknown: what palettes 1 and 9 are for.\\ \par
