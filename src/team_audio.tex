\section{Musics}
Like for their previous games, id decided to contract Bobby Prince Jr for the musics of the game and some audio effects. He was contacted before the game was up and running. All he was given was the "Doom" bible, a document authored by Tom Halls which acted as a design doc describing the tone of the game.\\

\fq{Much of what was in Doom Bible never appeared in the game, but it set a mood for starting on the project. Within a few months of receiving that document, I had roughed out a lot of music and most of what turned out to be final sound effects.}{Bobby Prince, Retro Gamer 44.}

Even though id Software gave directions it did not prevent Bobby to innovate and take initiatives.\\

\fq{The id Software development team originally wanted me to do nothing but metal songs for DOOM. I did not think that this type of music would be appropriate throughout the game, but I roughed out several original songs and also created MIDI sequences of some cover material. This was before any level design and was before most of the artwork had been created. As the game came together, the guys at id saw that this type of music was not appropriate for many of the levels in DOOM. Thinking that this would be the case, I had also roughed out a lot of ambient moody background music, much of which ended up in the game. This song ("At Doom's Gate") was one of the first of its type that I wrote. I heard it as being on a level that went by real fast. As it turns out, John Romero (who placed all of the songs on the levels) decided it was a perfect song for the first level.}{Bobby}

\section{Sounds}
Audio effects were selected from an audio library commercialized by Sound Ideas. It was not an obscure company but a major sound studio producing AAA sound effects. So well regarded they were used by Hollywood studios, even to this day.\\

An astuned ear will recognize the sound of door opening in the music video of "Body Movin" by the Beastie Boys\footnote{5:09 mark.}.\\

\trivia{Even wondered what kind of misture of different animals and sound could have possibly been at the origin of the imp dying sound? It is the sound of a camel. A plain and simple camel.}\\
