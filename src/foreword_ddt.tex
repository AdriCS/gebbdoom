I'm not proud of \doom{}.  It lowered grade point averages.  It ruined relationships.  It wasted people's time.\\

Nevertheless, you get treated as something like a hero for having worked on it.  It wasn't the same as saving lives, developing clean energy, raising children well, or weening us off animal agriculture.  The people doing these things are the real heroes of this planet, and they should be very proud of their work.\\
\par
That said, I know I shared a taste of what these real heroes do.  I would recommend to anyone that you do the terrifying thing that can't be done, to apply for the job you're not qualified for, to sneak in the things that speak to your soul, and to embrace the white hot panic of pressure and let it drive you towards completion.\\

If you're doing something hard and new, getting there won't be clean or orderly.  You will be myopically distracted by the little things in your days.  You will be fighting against your character flaws.  You will doubt yourself and wonder whether it wouldn't be wiser to do the safer, more popular thing.  You will worry about the timing and about your competition.  Mistakes will be made, and you will regret the things you had hoped to complete in time.\\
\par
But in the fury of your focus, whether recognized or ignored, you will learn and grow.  And if you're lucky, you will inspire others to follow suit.\\
